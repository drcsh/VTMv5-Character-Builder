# Readme

This is a web application for creating character for use in Vampire The Masquarade v5. It includes both minor characters for use by the storyteller, and main characters which can be used by players.

This is a WIP. 

# Todo:

1. finish model structure for characters
  * minor character wellbeing tracker
  * character rituals

2. build interfaces for:
  * Signing up
  * Creating and managing a Chronicle
  * creating/editing/viewing minor characters
  * the same for main characters (much more complicated)

3. Further features:
  * Manage users in a chronicle
  * Character Map
