# Readme

This is a web application for creating character for use in Vampire The Masquarade v5. It includes both minor characters for use by the storyteller, and main characters which can be used by players.

This is a WIP. 

# Todo:

1. build interfaces for:
  * Signing up as a Storyteller
  * Signing up as a Player
  * (Storyteller) Creating and managing a Chronicle
  * (Storyteller) creating/editing/viewing minor characters
  * (Storyteller) the same for main characters (much more complicated)
  * (Player) creating your character sheet

2. Further features:
  * Manage users in a chronicle
  * Character Relationship Map

# Done 

1. The models are basically done at this point, pending some refinement
